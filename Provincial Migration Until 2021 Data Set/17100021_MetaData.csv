1,"Period from July 1 to June 30."
2,"Interprovincial migration represents movements from one province or territory to another, involving a change in usual place of residence. A person who takes up residence in another province or territory is an out-migrant with reference to the province or territory of origin, and an in-migrant with reference to the province or territory of destination. Net interprovincial migration is the difference between the number of in-migrants and the number of out-migrants."
9,"The number of interprovincial migrants is final up to 2019/2020 and preliminary for 2020/2021."
10,"The population growth, which is used to calculate population estimates, is comprised of the natural growth (Table 17100008), international migration (Table 17100008) and interprovincial migration (Tables 17100008, 17100021 and 17100022)."
3,"From 1971/1972 to 1975/1976, estimates are based on Family Allowance data. From 1976/1977 to 2019/2020, estimates are based on Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) tax data. For 2020/2021, estimates are based on Canada child benefit data from CRA."
8,"From 1971/1972 to 1975/1976, in-migrant, out-migrant and net-migration totals do not include migration between Yukon and Northwest Territories including Nunavut."
5,"From 1971/1972 to 1975/1976, were based on Family Allowance data. From 1976/1977 to 1990/1991, estimates were based on Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) tax data. Data for Northwest Territories and Nunavut are presented separately from 1991/1992."
6,"From 1971/1972 to 1975/1976, the total of interprovincial in- and out-migrants as well as net-migration totals do not take into account migration between Yukon and Northwest Territories including Nunavut nor between Northwest Territories and Nunavut. From 1976/1977 to 1990/1991, in-migrant, out-migrant and net-migration totals include migration between Yukon and Northwest Territories including Nunavut, but do not include migration between Northwest Territories and Nunavut."
4,"Prior to 1991/1992, the total of interprovincial in- and out- migrants excludes migration between Northwest Territories and Nunavut."
7,"Prior to 1991/1992, only data for Northwest Territories and Nunavut combined are available. From 1991/1992 to 2019/2020, estimates are based on Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) tax data. For 2020/2021, estimates are based on Canada child benefit data from CRA."
